So firt take a bowl and insert flour{2 1/2cups(310g)}then insert cocoa powder{2 tablespoon(16g)}and then insert baking soda(1 teaspoon)and obviusly salt(1 teaspoon).after you have inseted thes ingridients, filter these mixed ingridients.then chun it a little bit and keep a side.now take a new bowl and insert butter[room temparature{1/2 cup(115g)}] then insert suger{1 1/2 cups(300g)} and then beat untill smooth.Then add 2 eggs(combined edition) then beat until combined.then mainly add vegitable oil{1 cup - 1 tablespoon(200g)},again beat untill combined.after mixing when you see that it look like batter then add vineger(1 teaspoon) and buttermilk{1 cup(240ml)},beat untill combined.then gadualy add the flour mixture (that I told you to keep aside).Mix after each addition untill well combined.Then add vanilla extract(2 teaspoons)in the choco mixture.Then mix again a little bit and then add red food colouring{1 tablespoon(1 more if needed)}.mix it again untill the colour of the batter becomes pink-redish.Now it depends on you size of bking pan.first take a baking paper woch should be a little bit bigger from than chosen pan.Then keep the baking pan on it and insert the red-pinkish batter in the pan.Now put the batter inside the oven.Bake it for 350F(175 C) for 30-40 mins untill a toothpick is inserted in center comes out clean.Now I know tht if you hear this you are going to be depressed but you don't want to miss you cake party so you have to do the whole prosess again so that your cake will be bigger and tastier.Now take a bowl and insert Cream cheese{2 cups(450g)} then powdered sugar{1 1/2cups(190g)} and then again vanilla extract and beat untill smooth.Now take another bowl and insert heavy cream{1 1/4 cups(300ml)}and wipp to stiff peaks.Then gradually fold into the cream cheese mixture and keep it aside for later use.Now cut the top of the cakes and keep.Now take one cut head and if you have any shape cutter ex haert then cut the cut the head in small small heart shape tiny cakes(5-6pieces).Now with that leftover you have to make crumbs of it and collect it in a small bowl.Now take a piece of cake (from where we cut of the head) and spread some a layer of frosting(the cheese cream that we created)on that cake.And take one more peice of that cake and place it gently on the frost were we spread.Now we are done with two layer cake.Now the fun part begins coting the whole cke with frosting but first again take some frosting and put on the top of the double lyer cake and then take the last bit of frosting in gently spred it over the sides of the cake.and also don't forget about smoothing the top and the sides or it will look dull.Now it will be a little bit diffecult now,you have to sppread the cake crumbs over the sides and remember not on the tops.Now decorate the cake top with the cutted heart and you are done!For more information you can see this link in the brackets(https://youtu.be/vGE-RfP6KRE).And remember to enjoy.Have a nice day.Bon apetet!
